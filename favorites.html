<ol>
    <li> <h2> Durban in Winter </h2>
     Head to Durban where icy winters are unheard of even during winter 
    in South Africa. <br> Pleasant temperatures, low humidity, little rainfall and 
    fewer crowds make this coastal city a heavenly retreat for outdoor adventurists 
    during the winter.</li>
<br>

    <li> <h2> Johannesburg in Winter </h2>
        In South Africa’s largest city, a tour to Johannesburg features many of the 
        country’s historic landmarks and cultural events. <br> Expect the city to host a bevy 
        of festivals during the winter months in South Africa. <br> 
        Daytime temperatures are high enough to enjoy the outdoor events but make sure 
        to bring warm clothes for chilly nights.
    </li>
<br>   

    <li><h2> Kruger National Park in Winter </h2>
        Kruger is one of the best destinations in South Africa for wildlife viewing on any day. <br>
        Want to increase your chances of spotting all the Big 5 on a Kruger safari? Winter season 
        in South Africa is your best option. <br> Lions, rhinos, elephants, Cape buffalos and other animals 
        are seen more frequently in the park during the cooler, drier winter months. Go catch them all!
    </li>
<br>

    <li><h2> Stellenbosch in Winter </h2>
        A tour to the Stellenbosch should be on your list as its wine region can be one of the coziest places 
        to visit in South Africa in winter. <br> Stellenbosch’s rustic countryside is capped with rows of vineyards 
        and awe-inspiring peaks, but the winter in <br> South Africa disrupts views with rain and overcast. Dreary
        winter days are spent snuggled up by the fireplace and sampling <br> the tastiest wines from local 
        sommeliers without the crowds.
    </li>
<br>

    <li><h2> Cape Town in Winter </h2>
        Known for the iconic Table Mountain and its immaculate beaches, Cape Town is one of South Africa’s most 
        picturesque destinations. <br> With dropping temperatures, blustery winds and increased rainfall, winter can 
        be unpredictable in Cape Town. But the city’s dwindling crowds can lead to <br> a world of discovery when 
        finding things to do in South Africa in winter.

    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>        
        <strong>MACARONS</strong> <br>
        <br>
        1 ¾ cups powdered sugar(210 g) <br><br>
        1 cup almond flour(95 g), finely ground <br><br>
        1 teaspoon salt, divided <br><br>
        3 egg whites, at room temperature <br><br>
        ¼ cup granulated sugar(50 g) <br><br>
        ½ teaspoon vanilla extract <br><br>
        2 drops pink gel food coloring <br><br>
        <br>
        <strong>VANILLA BUTTERCREAM </strong><br>
        <br>
        1 cup unsalted butter(230 g), 2 sticks (at room temperature) <br><br>
        3 cups powdered sugar(360 g) <br><br>
        1 teaspoon vanilla extract <br><br>
        3 tablespoons heavy cream <br><br></td>

<td>    1. Make the macarons: In the bowl of a food processor, combine the powdered sugar, <br>
          almond flour, and ½ teaspoon of salt, and process on low speed, until extra fine. <br>
          Sift the almond flour mixture through a fine-mesh sieve into a large bowl.<br>
          <br>
        2. In a separate large bowl, beat the egg whites and the remaining ½ teaspoon of <br>
        salt with an electric hand mixer until soft peaks form. Gradually add the granulated <br>
        sugar until fully incorporated. Continue to beat until stiff peaks form (you should <br>
        be able to turn the bowl upside down without anything falling out).<br>
        <br>
        3. Add the vanilla and beat until incorporated. Add the food coloring and beat <br>
        until just combined.<br>
        <br>
        4. Add about ⅓ of the sifted almond flour mixture at a time to the beaten egg whites and <br>
        use a spatula to gently fold until combined. After the last addition of almond flour, <br>
        continue to fold slowly until the batter falls into ribbons and you can make a figure <br>
        8 while holding the spatula up.<br>
        <br>
        5. Transfer the macaron batter into a piping bag fitted with a round tip.<br>
        <br>
        6. Place 4 dots of the batter in each corner of a rimmed baking sheet, and <br>
        place a piece of parchment paper over it, using the batter to help adhere the <br>
        parchment to the baking sheet.<br>
        <br>
        7. Pipe the macarons onto the parchment paper in 1½-inch (3-cm) circles, spacing at <br>
        least 1-inch (2-cm) apart.<br>
        <br>
        8. Tap the baking sheet on a flat surface 5 times to release any air bubbles.<br>
        <br>
        9. Let the macarons sit at room temperature for 30 minutes to 1 hour, until dry to the touch.<br>
        <br>
        10. Preheat the oven to 300˚F (150˚C).<br>
        <br>
        11. Bake the macarons for 17 minutes, until the feet are well-risen and the macarons don’t <br>
        stick to the parchment paper.<br>
        <br>
        12. Transfer the macarons to a wire rack to cool completely before filling.<br>
        <br>
        13. Make the buttercream: In a large bowl, add the butter and beat with a mixer for 1 minute <br>
        until light and fluffy. Sift in the powdered sugar and beat until fully incorporated. <br>
        <br>
        14. Add the vanilla and beat to combine. Add the cream, 1 tablespoon at a time, and beat <br>
        to combine, until desired consistency is reached.<br>
        <br>
        15. Transfer the buttercream to a piping bag fitted with a round tip.<br>
        <br>
        16. Add a dollop of buttercream to one macaron shell. Top it with another macaron shell <br> 
        to create a sandwich. Repeat with remaining macaron shells and buttercream.<br>
        <br>
        16. Place in an airtight container for 24 hours to “bloom”.<br>
        <br>
        17. Enjoy! <br></td>
